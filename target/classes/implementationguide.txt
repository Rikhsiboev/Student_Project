*Before writing code, check the Common git&github update cycle image provided in the discord group channel.

*Write your codes in your own branch.

*Main responsibility for all developers is implementing all CRUD methods successfully.

*We are going to merge our codes in the master branch, after review. (for the master branch we should ask for 2 reviewers).

*How to create implementation classes and methods?

        Example:
            public class CourseService implements CRUDService<Course> {
                @Override
                public Course findById(int id) {
                    return Database.courseList.stream()
                            .filter(course -> course.id == id)
                            .findFirst().orElseThrow();
                }
            }

*Branch management and merging process is important. Pay attention.
